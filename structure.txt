The code as of 10/17/2013 was pretty much all hacked together during HackMIT 2013. As a result the code is pretty hard to read and debug. I'm going to restructure the code so it's easier to add more functionality, test, and debug.

0) Reading input
	Specify number of authors, training examples per author.
	Store sentence-author pairs as objects.
	

1) Training
	Naive Bayesian predictor
	Perceptron
	Neural network with backpropogation

	Use get_next_example() to get a training example.


2) Testing
	Should be able to specify number of authors, number of tests, which predictor
